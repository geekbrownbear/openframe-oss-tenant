## Your First 5 Actions

Here are the first 5 things you should do after getting OpenFrame running:

### 1. Complete Your Tenant Setup

Navigate to **Settings** → **Company and Users**:

```text
✅ Set up your company profile
✅ Configure your primary contact information
✅ Upload your company logo
✅ Set your timezone and locale preferences
```

**Why this matters**: Proper tenant configuration ensures all features work correctly and data is properly attributed.

### 2. Create Your First Organization

Organizations represent your clients in OpenFrame. Create a test organization:

1. Go to **Organizations** → **New Organization**
2. Fill in the basic details:
   - **Name**: "Demo Client MSP"
   - **Contact Email**: "admin@democlient.com"
   - **Phone**: Your test number
   - **Address**: Your test address

3. Save the organization

**Expected result**: You should see the organization listed in your dashboard with a status of "Active".

### 3. Register Your First Device

Test the device registration process:

1. Navigate to **Devices** → **New Device**
2. Copy the registration command provided
3. Run it on a test machine (or virtual machine):

```bash
# Example registration command (yours will be different)
curl -sSL https://install.openframe.dev/register | bash -s -- \
  --tenant-id=your-tenant-id \
  --registration-secret=your-secret
```

4. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh the Devices page

**Expected result**: Your test device appears in the devices list with connection status and basic hardware information.

### 4. Meet Mingo, Your AI Assistant

Explore the AI capabilities that make OpenFrame powerful:

1. Navigate to **Mingo** in the sidebar
2. Start with these example conversations:

```text
"Help me understand my current infrastructure setup"

"What devices need attention?"

"Create a maintenance checklist for this month"

"Explain what services are currently running"
```

**Expected result**: Mingo provides intelligent responses based on your platform data and suggests actionable next steps.

### 5. Generate Your First API Key

Set up programmatic access for integrations:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create New API Key**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: "Development Testing"
   - **Description**: "For learning and testing API endpoints"
   - **Permissions**: Start with "Read Only"

4. Copy and save the API key securely

**Expected result**: You receive a secure API key that you can use to access OpenFrame's external APIs programmatically.
